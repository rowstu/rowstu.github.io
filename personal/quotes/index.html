If anyone has harmed me in any way either knowingly or through their own confusions, I forgive them. 

And if there is a situation I am not yet ready to forgive, I forgive myself for that. 

For all the ways that I harm myself, negate, doubt, belittle myself, judge or be unkind to myself through my own confusions, I forgive myself.
--Buddhist Prayer

God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change; 
courage to change the things I can; 
and wisdom to know the difference.

Living one day at a time; 
enjoying one moment at a time; 
accepting hardships as the pathway to peace; 
taking, as He did, this sinful world
as it is, not as I would have it; 
trusting that He will make all things right
if I surrender to His Will; 
that I may be reasonably happy in this life
and supremely happy with Him
forever in the next. 
Amen.
-- Reinhold Niebuhr (1892-1971)

Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace. 
Where there is hatred, let me sow love; 
Where there is injury, pardon; 
Where there is doubt, faith; 
Where there is despair, hope; 
Where there is darkness, light; 
Where there is sadness, joy. 
O divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek To be consoled as to console,
To be understood as to understand, To be loved as to love; 
For it is in giving that we receive; 
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned; 
It is in dying to self that we are born to eternal life.

-- St. Francis of Assisi

&#34;The final awakening is the embracing of the darkness into the light. That means embracing our humanity as well as our divinity. What we go from is being born into our humanity, sleep walking for a long time, until we awaken and start to taste our divinity. And then we want to finally get free, but we see as long as we grab at our divinity and push away our humanity we aren’t free. If you want to be free, you can’t push away anything. You have to embrace it all. It’s all God.&#34; -- Ram Dass

You want to get to the place where, when there is depression, instead of running and hiding from the depression by trying to grab at the next high, you turn around and look at the depression as though you were looking the devil in the eye. You say to the depression, &#39;Come on depression, do your trip, because you’re just a depression, and here I am. -- Ram Dass

&#34;When you say, &#39;I am,&#39; followed by any other words, you are already trying to stand somewhere. There’s nowhere to stand in this whole dance. You can’t stand somewhere when you say, &#39;I am good.&#39; There is stuff in you that isn’t so good. You say, &#39;I am young,&#39; yet get old. &#39;I am alive,&#39; you will be dead. Every definition of yourself is a prison you put yourself in, seemingly to protect yourself. But it ends up creating anxiety and fear. Most of the behavior that our society performs is motivated by fear. And it is the fear of what is. &#34; --Ram Dass

&#34;You are existing at many planes simultaneously at this moment. The only reason you don’t know of your other identities is because you’re so attached to this one. But this one or that one; don’t get lost, don’t stick anywhere. It’s just more stuff. Go for broke, awake totally. &#34; --Ram Dass

&#34;After a while, you come to appreciate that what you can offer another human being is to work on yourself to be a statement of what it is you have found in the way you live your life. One of the things you have found or will find is the ability to appreciate what is, as it is, in equanimity and compassion and love that isn&#39;t conditional; that is, you don&#39;t love a person more because they are happier the way you think they should be.

What you cultivate in yourself is the garden in which they can grow, and you offer your consciousness and the spaciousness to hear it.&#34; -- Ram Dass

“When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind.” 
― Jiddu Krishnamurti
 
“Years of love have been forgot, in the hatred of a minute” 
— Edgar Allan Poe
 
“My dear, Find what you love and let it kill you. Let it drain you of your all. Let it cling onto your back and weigh you down into eventual nothingness. Let it kill you and let it devour your remains. For all things will kill you, both slowly and fastly, but it’s much better to be killed by a lover.”
— Charles Bukowski
 
“Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else’s opinions. Their lives a mimicry. Their passions a quotation.” 
— Oscar Wilde
 
“He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.” 
— Nietzsche
 
“People say that what we’re all seeking is a meaning for life. I don’t think that’s what we’re really seeking. I think that what we’re seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances with our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive.” 
― Joseph Campbell, The Power of Myth
 
“No man knows how bad he is till he has tried very hard to be good. A silly idea is current that good people do not know what temptation means. This is an obvious lie. Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is. After all, you find out the strength of the German Army by fighting it, not by giving in. You find out the strength of the wind by trying to walk against it, not by lying down. A man who gives in to temptation after five minutes simply does not know what it would have been like an hour later. That is why bad people, in one sense, know very little about badness. They have lived a sheltered life by always giving in. We never find out the strength of the evil impulse inside us until we try to fight it.”
— C.S. Lewis
  
The ability to observe without evaluating is the highest form of intelligence. 
—Jiddu Krishnamurti
 
“There are two ways to live: you can live as if nothing is a miracle, or you can live as if everything is a miracle.” 
— Albert Einstein
 
“We must become so alone, so utterly alone, that we withdraw into our innermost self. It is a way of bitter suffering. But then our solitude is overcome, we are no longer alone, for we find that our innermost self is the spirit, that it is God, the indivisible. And suddenly we find ourselves in the midst of the world, yet undisturbed by its multiplicity, for our innermost soul we know ourselves to be one with all being.“
— Hermann Hesse
 
Now is the time to get serious about living your ideals. How long can you afford to put off who you really want to be? Your nobler self cannot wait any longer. Put your principles into practice – now. Stop the excuses and the procrastination. This is your life! You aren’t a child anymore. The sooner you set yourself to your spiritual program, the happier you will be. The longer you wait, the more you’ll be vulnerable to mediocrity and feel filled with shame and regret, because you know you are capable of better. From this instant on, vow to stop disappointing yourself. Separate yourself from the mob. Decide to be extraordinary and do what you need to do – now.
— Epictetus.
 
“The world is full of magic things, patiently waiting for our senses to grow sharper.“
W.B. Yeats
  
“Those who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night. In their gray visions they obtain glimpses of eternity, and thrill, in waking, to find that they have been upon the verge of the great secret. In snatches, they learn something of the wisdom which is of good, and more of the mere knowledge which is of evil.“
Edgar Allan Poe
 
“We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.“
Carl Sagan
 
“The unexamined life is not worth living.“
Socrates
  
“The goal of life is to make your heartbeat match the beat of the universe, to match your nature with Nature.“
Joseph Campbell
  
“Make no mistakes about it – enlightenment is a destructive process. It has nothing to do with becoming better or being happier. Enlightenment is the crumbling away of the untruth. It’s seeing through the facade of pretense. It’s the complete eradication of everything we imagined to be true.” 
— Adyashanti
 
One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.
—Carl Jung
 
Meditation is the discovery that the point of life is always arrived at in the immediate moment. 
– Alan Watts
 
When you go out into the woods, and you look at trees, you see all these different trees. And some of them are bent, and some of them are straight, and some of them are evergreens, and some of them are whatever. And you look at the tree and you allow it. You see why it is the way it is. You sort of understand that it didn’t get enough light, and so it turned that way. And you don’t get all emotional about it. You just allow it. You appreciate the tree.
The minute you get near humans, you lose all that. And you are constantly saying ‘You are too this, or I’m too this.’ That judgment mind comes in. And so I practice turning people into trees. Which means appreciating them just the way they are.
— Ram Dass. 
 
Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under, it will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering it’s a feather bed.
― Terence McKenna

We have not even to risk the adventure alone
for the heroes of all time have gone before us.
The labyrinth is thoroughly known …
we have only to follow the thread of the hero path.
And where we had thought to find an abomination
we shall find a God.
And where we had thought to slay another
we shall slay ourselves.
Where we had thought to travel outwards
we shall come to the center of our own existence.
And where we had thought to be alone
we shall be with all the world.” 
― Joseph Campbell

People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own souls. They will practice Indian yoga and all its exercises, observe a strict regimen of diet, learn the literature of the whole world – all because they cannot get on with themselves and have not the slightest faith that anything useful could ever come out of their own souls. Thus the soul has gradually been turned into a Nazareth from which nothing good can come. 
— Carl Jung
 
The obstacle is the path. 
—Zen Proverb
 
The opposite of a correct statement is a false statement. But the opposite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth. 
—Niels Bohr
 
If I make the lashes dark
And the eyes more bright
And the lips more scarlet,
Or ask if all be right
From mirror after mirror,
No vanity’s displayed:
I’m looking for the face I had
Before the world was made.
— W.B. Yeats
 
When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe. 
— John Muir
 
If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts, but if he will content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties. 
— Francis Bacon
 
Losing an illusion makes you wiser than finding a truth. 
— Ludwig Börne
 
When another person makes you suffer, it is because he suffers deeply within himself, and his suffering is spilling over. He does not need punishment; he needs help. That’s the message he is sending.
― Thich Nhat Hanh
 
He who has seen present things has seen all, both everything which has taken place from all eternity and everything which will be for time without end; for all things are of one kin and of one form. 
— Marcus Aurelius

somewhere when you say, &#39;I am good.&#39; There is stuff in you that isn’t so good.
You say, &#39;I am young,&#39; yet get old. &#39;I am alive,&#39; you will be dead. Every

&#34;After a while, you come to appreciate that what you can offer another human being is to work on yourself to be a statement of what it is you have found in the way you live your life. One of the things you have found or will find is the ability to appreciate what is, as it is, in equanimity and compassion and love that isn&#39;t conditional; that is, you don&#39;t love a person more because they are happier the way you think they should be.

If you are pained by any external thing, it is not this thing that disturbs you, but your own judgment about it. And it is in your power to wipe out this judgment now.
- Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

Things stand outside of us, themselves by themselves, neither knowing anything of themselves nor expressing any judgment.
- Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

Today I escaped from anxiety. Or no, I discarded it, because it was within me, in my own perceptions — not outside.
- Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

[It is] like seeing roasted meat and other dishes in front of you and suddenly realizing: This is a dead fish. A dead bird. A dead pig. Or that this noble vintage [wine] is rotted grapes… perceptions like that... latching onto things and piercing through them, to see what they really are… to strip away the legend that encrusts them.”
- Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

We should always be asking ourselves: “Is this something that is, or is not, in my control?”
- Epictetus, Enchiridion

Define for me now what the “indifferents” are. Whatever things we cannot control. Tell me the upshot. They are nothing to me.
- Epictetus, Enchiridion

It’s something like going on an ocean voyage. What can I do? Pick the captain, the boat, the date, and the best time to sail. But then a storm hits… What are my options? I do the only thing I am in a position to do, drown — but fearlessly, without bawling or crying out to God, because I know that what is born must also die.
- Epictetus, Discourses

Take a lyre player: he’s relaxed when he performs alone, but put him in front of an audience, and it’s a different story, no matter how beautiful his voice or how well he plays the instrument. Why? Because he not only wants to perform well, he wants to be well received — and the latter lies outside his control.
- Epictetus, Enchiridion

Let us meet with bravery whatever may befall us. Let us never feel a shudder at the thought of being wounded or of being made a prisoner, or of poverty or persecution.
- Seneca, Letters from a Stoic

Floods will rob us of one thing, fire of another. These are conditions of our existence which we cannot change. What we can do is adopt a noble spirit, such a spirit as befits a good person, so that we may bear up bravely under all that fortune sends us and bring our wills into tune with nature’s.
- Seneca, Letters from a Stoic

Cling tooth and nail to the following rule: not to give in to adversity, never to trust prosperity, and always take full note of fortune’s habit of behaving just as she pleases, treating her as if she were actually going to do everything it is in her power to do. Whatever you have been expecting for some time comes as less of a shock.
- Seneca, Letters from a Stoic

Fate leads the willing, and drags along the reluctant.
- Seneca, Letters from a Stoic

Whatever happens to you has been waiting to happen since the beginning of time. The twining strands of fate wove both of them together.
- Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

Plato has a fine saying, that he who would discourse of man should survey, as from some high watchtower, the things of earth.
- Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

Remember: Matter. How tiny your share of it. Time. How brief and fleeting your allotment of it. Fate. How small a role you play in it.
- Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind…and clear out space for yourself… by comprehending the scale of the world… by contemplating infinite time… by thinking of the speed with which things change — each part of every thing; the narrow space between our birth and death; the infinite time before; the equally unbounded time that follows.
- Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

Asia and Europe: distant recesses of the universe. The ocean: a drop of water. Mount Athos: a molehill. The present: a split second in eternity. Minuscule, transitory, insignificant.
- Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.
-Steve Jobs

Take time to deliberate, but when the time for action comes, stop thinking and go in.
-Napoleon Bonaparte

Be a free thinker and don’t accept everything you hear as truth. Be critical and evaluate what you believe in.
-Aristotle

The proof that you know something is that you are able to teach it.
-Aristotle

It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.
-Epictetus

Sometimes people don’t want to hear the truth because they don’t want their illusions destroyed.
When you want success as badly as you want the air, then you will get it. There is no other secret of success.
-Socrates

It is better to change an opinion than to persist in a wrong one.
-Socrates

The intelligence consists not only in the knowledge but also in the skill to apply the knowledge into practice.
-Aristotle

Thinking is a habit, and like any other habit, it can be changed; it just takes effort and repetition.
-John Eliot

There are two different types of people in the world, those who want to know, and those who want to believe.
-Friedrich Nietzsche

Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.
-Søren Kierkegaard

We can’t learn without pain.
-Aristotle

The oldest, shortest words, ‘yes’ and ‘no’ - are those which require the most thought.
-Pythagoras

We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then is a habit.
-Socrates

If you think you can do a thing or think you can’t do a thing, you’re right.
-Henry Ford

If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid.
-Epictetus

Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort,
and intelligent execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives - choice,
not chance, determines your destiny.
 -Aristotle
