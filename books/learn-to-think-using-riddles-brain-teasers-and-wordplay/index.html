The bartender then begins to search for something underneath the bar. Suddenly, he brings out a firearm and points it straight at the man. The man simply says, &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; and immediately leaves.</p><p>The man had hiccups, the bar tender noticed this and rather than giving him the glass of water decided to scare the hiccups away by presenting the weapon, therefore relieving the man of hiccups.</p><p>A man is lying in an open field, dead. Next to him lies an unopened package. There isn&rsquo;t another animal or person around him." How did the man die? HINT: As he got closer to the field he knew he was going to die.</p><p>The package is his unopened parachute.</p><p>A woman gives birth to two sons; they are both born in the same hour, in the same day, in the same year. However, they are not twins. How could this be?</p><p>The two boys are not twins, they are triplets.</p><p>A man dies and goes to heaven one day. There he discovers thousands of people, and all of them are naked. He scans around to try to find someone he might know. He then sees a couple and instantly recognizes them-they are Adam and Eve. How does he know they are Adam and Eve?</p><p>It&rsquo;s not that they had fig leaves around their privates but that they had no belly buttons as they were not born of a human mother.</p><p>A woman shoots her husband, then holds him underwater for five full minutes. A little later on in the day, they both go out for dinner and have a nice time together. How can this be?</p><p>She shoots a photograph and then develops the photo in solution in her dark room.</p><p>These are examples of situational riddles. usually involving some bizarre situation.</p><h3 id=complex-analytical-riddles>Complex Analytical Riddles</h3><p>Five men are walking together. It starts to rain, and so four of the men speed up and walk more quickly; the fifth man doesn&rsquo;t try to pick up pace-yet he stays dry. The other four men, however, get wet despite trying to avoid it. The five men all arrive together at their destination at the same time.</p><p>Analylsis suggests that 5 men walking together should get equally as wet as each other. The only explanation is that one of the men is dead and in a coffin.</p><p>To solve riddles like this, you will need to learn to use differential diagnostics, and logic with IF, THEN, AND, or BUT operators. e.g. IF he didn&rsquo;t get wet he must have been covered somehow or inside something.</p></div></div><script src=/assets/shared-nav.js></script></body></html>
