Let&rsquo;s break down what they are and how they work:</p><p><strong>1. QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections):</strong></p><p>QUIC is a transport protocol developed by Google to address some of the limitations of the traditional TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) combination that is commonly used for web communication. It was designed to overcome issues such as latency, packet loss, and head-of-line blocking.</p><p>Here are some key features and concepts of QUIC:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Multiplexing:</strong> QUIC allows multiple streams of data to be sent over a single connection. This means that multiple requests and responses can be processed concurrently without blocking each other.</p></li><li><p><strong>Low Latency:</strong> QUIC is designed to reduce connection establishment time, making it faster than TCP. It achieves this by using a modified version of TLS to encrypt data in the initial handshake, and by reducing the number of round trips required for setup.</p></li><li><p><strong>Error Correction:</strong> QUIC includes built-in error correction mechanisms, reducing the need for retransmissions in case of packet loss. This helps maintain a smoother and faster communication experience.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connection Migration:</strong> QUIC supports seamless migration of connections between different network interfaces (e.g., switching from Wi-Fi to cellular) without interrupting the connection.</p></li></ul><p><strong>2. HTTP/3:</strong></p><p>HTTP/3 is the latest version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which is used for fetching resources such as web pages, images, and videos from web servers. It is built on top of QUIC and is designed to improve the efficiency and security of web communication. Here are some key points about HTTP/3:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Multiplexing:</strong> HTTP/3 takes advantage of QUIC&rsquo;s multiplexing feature to send multiple HTTP requests and responses concurrently over a single connection. This leads to better utilization of network resources and reduced latency.</p></li><li><p><strong>Encryption:</strong> Like its predecessors (HTTP/1 and HTTP/2), HTTP/3 uses encryption through TLS to secure data in transit. However, HTTP/3 benefits from the improved security features of QUIC&rsquo;s initial handshake.</p></li><li><p><strong>Header Compression:</strong> HTTP/3 uses a more efficient header compression algorithm called &ldquo;HPACK&rdquo; compared to HTTP/1.1, which uses &ldquo;gzip&rdquo; or &ldquo;deflate.&rdquo; This helps reduce overhead and speeds up communication.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connection Migration:</strong> HTTP/3, being based on QUIC, can also take advantage of QUIC&rsquo;s ability to migrate connections between different network interfaces without disruption.</p></li><li><p><strong>Improved Performance:</strong> HTTP/3 is designed to work well in high-latency and lossy network conditions. It mitigates head-of-line blocking issues, leading to faster and more responsive web pages.</p></li></ul><p>Overall, QUIC and HTTP/3 aim to make web communication faster, more reliable, and more secure by leveraging modern networking and encryption techniques. Many major websites and content delivery networks (CDNs) have started adopting these technologies to enhance user experiences on the web.</p></div></div><script src=/assets/shared-nav.js></script></body></html>
